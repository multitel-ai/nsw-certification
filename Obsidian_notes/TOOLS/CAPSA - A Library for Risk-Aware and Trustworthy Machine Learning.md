/!\ Maintenant c'est plus opensource, c'est devenu CAPSA PRO /!\


**Capsa**, a flexible framework for extending models to become risk-aware, achieves this by providing two vital components that work together:

> **1.** Streamlined implementations of state-of-the-art methodologies for quantifying risk. Convert your models into risk-aware ones without changing any of your architecture and training code – capsa takes care of the entire conversion process!
> 
> **2.** Composition of different algorithms together to quantify different risk metrics in parallel and minimize their impact on hardware resources.
