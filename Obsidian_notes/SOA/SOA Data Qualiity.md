# Concepts

## What are the 6 dimensions of data quality?
-   **Completeness**: The dataset must be complete with no empty grids or spots in the datasets. Every cell should have a data piece in it. 
-   **Comprehensiveness**: The datasets should be as comprehensive as they can get. For instance, if you’re looking for a cyber threat vector, then you must have all signature profiles and all necessary information. 
-   **Consistency**: The datasets must fit under the definite variables they have been assigned to. For instance, if you’re modeling package boxes, your selected variables (plastic, paper, cardboard, etc.) must have appropriate pricing data to fall into those definite categories. 
-   **Accuracy**: Accuracy is the key to a good dataset. All the information you feed the AI model must be trustworthy and completely accurate. If large portions of your datasets are incorrect, your output will be inaccurate too.  
-   **Uniqueness**: This point is similar to consistency. Each data point must be unique to the variable it is serving. For instance, you don’t want to price of a plastic wrapper to fall under any other category of packaging.y
